**PLOTS**

![Count of authors of best sellers"](../Images/authorofbestseller.jpg "Count of authors of best sellers")
![Genre based bestseller count over the years](../Images/genre_based_bestseller.jpg "Genre based bestseller count over the years")
![Rating count"](../Images/ratingcount.jpg "Rating count")

**CONCLUSION**

  

We investigated the data, checking for data unbalancing, visualizing the features, and understanding the relationship between different features.
Few insights were:
* The Data has no missing values
* Reviews and Price also tend to show an almost similar correlation as User Rating and Price.But again as most of the Bestsellers are crowded in a lower Price range,we can't conclude much.
* For ratings less than 4.8,Non-Fiction books count overpowers Fiction books. But the reverse can be seen for the ratings-4.8 and 4.9.This is an important point as ,earlier we have seen that non-fiction books have an overall higher count in the entire dataset.
* No FREE bestsellers in 2012 and after 2017.
